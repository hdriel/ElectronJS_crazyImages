# Crazy Images project

### An Electron JS Project

I wrote a program that makes filtering of effects on images.

This project I did in ElectronJS was used with management controllers in **Angular** and **JS** and design the software using **css html**.

(Here are illustrations of the project itself:)
<u>Actions on the software:</u>

* The software allows the user to upload an image with the known formats of jpg, jpeg, png.
